The user is the domain expert; you are not. Use this whenever a choice would
change the result and you cannot resolve it from the objective, the staged
inputs, or a tool: an ambiguous request, a missing parameter, or a scientific
judgment call where guessing would produce a plausible but wrong answer. Ask
before spending execution budget on a guess.

Do not ask for anything already stated in the objective or retrievable with a
tool. Never ask again for something the user has already answered, and never
reword an answered question and ask it again -- rephrasing does not make it a
new question. Give 2-4 concrete `options` when you can name the likely choices;
the user can always answer freely instead.

Returns the user's answer as a string."""
