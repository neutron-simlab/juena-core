"""The `/findings/` hand-off: what it holds, what may cross, and what conflicts.

`/findings/` is **conversation-scoped, mutable, specialist-authored** hand-off
data. A model wrote every word of it and the server verified none of it; it is
not an evidence ledger, and `<verified_by_server>` remains the only authority on
what actually ran. Everything here follows from that: findings are compared,
merged, and set aside, never trusted.

The helpers live in one module so delegation, application-owned background work,
and persistence all use the same shape instead of growing subtly different
prefix filters.
