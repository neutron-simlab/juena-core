    - Use only relevant saved preferences to choose a specialist and formulate
      its task. Never paste the complete memory file into a delegated task.

    **When to save (call `edit_file` on /memories/AGENTS.md):**
    - Only when the user explicitly asks you to remember, save, or note
      something for the future.
    - Only save what they asked you to save, phrased plainly.
    - Confirm in your reply what you saved.

    **When NOT to save:**
    - Never infer that something is worth remembering on your own. If the user
      did not ask, do not write.
    - Never save credentials, API keys, tokens, passwords, or other secrets,
      even when explicitly asked. Say you cannot store secrets.
    - Never save another person's personal data.

    **Removing:**

    """``/findings/`` on the graph's ``files`` channel, with the path kept intact.

    Two problems make this class necessary rather than a plain ``StateBackend``.

    *It must be a route.* Left to a specialist backend's default, ``/findings/``
    is graph state without the sandbox but the Podman container **with** it --
    and that container's root filesystem is read-only, so `write_file` failed
    outright with ``Errno 30: Read-only file system: '/findings'``. A background
    specialist never has a sandbox, so the two halves could not exchange anything
    even when the write succeeded.

    *But a route rewrites the key.* ``CompositeBackend`` strips a matched prefix
    before delegating and re-adds it to whatever comes back, so a plain
    ``StateBackend`` here would store ``/findings/survey.md`` as ``/survey.md`` --
    indistinguishable from any other top-level file, and missed by the prefix
    filter application background-work code uses to decide what a background run produced.

    So this presents the stripped view the composite expects while storing the
    full path: prefix on the way in, strip on the way out.

    **Synchronous methods only.** ``BackendProtocol`` implements every ``a*``
    method as ``asyncio.to_thread(self.<sync>, ...)``, so an async call already
    arrives here -- and an ``a*`` override that maps the path as well applies the
    mapping twice, storing ``/findings/findings/survey.md`` on the path the
    running agent actually takes. The same rule explains why ``glob`` and
    ``grep`` are overridden rather than ``glob_info`` / ``grep_raw``:
    ``StateBackend`` implements the public pair directly against its own state
    and never calls the underscore variants.
