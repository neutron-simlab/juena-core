"""The boundary a specialist is invoked across.

`SubAgentMiddleware` hands a subagent the parent's whole state minus its private
keys, and copies the subagent's whole state back the same way. That is a sensible
default for an agent framework and the wrong one here, for two reasons that only
show up in this agent topology:

*Going in.* The supervisor's `files` channel is not only findings. Summarization
parks evicted conversation turns under `/conversation_history/` through the same
channel, so a specialist -- which is told it cannot see the conversation -- was
being handed the part of it the supervisor had already thrown away.

*Coming back.* Everything the run left in `files` returns, including findings it
merely inherited on the way in. Re-writing an unchanged file is harmless until
something else edits it in the meantime.

Neither is fixed by asking the specialist not to look, and neither should depend
on remembering to re-check after the next upstream release adds a state field. So
each specialist is registered through this adapter, which names what may cross in
each direction. `SubAgentMiddleware` keeps its own semantics; the boundary is
decided here, before invocation.
