"""Agent invocation, streaming, resume, thread deletion and artifact download.

**This module has no ``from __future__ import annotations``, deliberately**,
unlike every other module in the package. ``build_api_router`` annotates the
``/resume`` body with the resume union the *application* passes in, and FastAPI
reads that annotation to parse the request. Deferred annotations are strings
resolved against module globals, where a factory argument does not exist; eager
ones are evaluated at definition time in the enclosing scope, where it does.

**Why this router is in core at all.** 00-BOUNDARY.md decision 10 says it stays
in each application, because it imports sandbox, approval and artifact
behaviour. Two of those are no longer true — artifacts are core's since 01/CP2,
and approvals are an application-registered interrupt kind since this
checkpoint — and the third, staging a thread's files somewhere a process can
read them, is a seam both applications need rather than a reason to keep two
copies: VITESS binaries read real files from disk exactly as a sandbox mount
does. Copying the router instead would put the SSE ordering, the ownership
check, the artifact drain and the thread-event emission in two places that must
not drift, and 01/CP4's own acceptance check — ``create_app(principal=…)``
listing ``/stream`` — cannot pass without it. Core's ``BaseAgentClient`` calls
these paths, so a core that does not define them ships a client with routes
nobody serves.

So the application supplies what is genuinely its own: its resume union, its
workspace, its stream policy, and the note closing a staged-input manifest.
